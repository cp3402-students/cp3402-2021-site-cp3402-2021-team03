We attempted to connect our github repository up to wordpress through the GitUpdater in wordpress
but we found that no changes were being made, so the back up was to copy all the changes that were pushed from 
the local development environment (PHP Storm) to github and paste them in the corresponding php files found in the theme editor, found in the backend of 
wordpress:

This allowed us to visually see any changes we had made to the theme.
