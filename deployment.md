Trello
https://trello.com/b/i09qsH5f/cp3402-project-team03

we used trello as a idea and planning board to outline what tasks we were going to acomplish. 
we outlined the main parts of the theme we were going to target to improve the website, including 
the navigation bar, the header, and the footer. we also barinstormed how each of these would look and what would 
be asthetically appealing.

Github:

We attempted to connect our github repository up to wordpress through the GitUpdater in wordpress
but we found that no changes were being made, so the back up was to copy all the changes that were pushed from 
the local development environment (PHP Storm) to github and paste them in the corresponding php files found in the theme editor, found in the backend of 
wordpress: This allowed us to visually see any changes we had made to the theme.

Website server

We used siteground as a hosting server to publish and visualise our website.


PHP Storm

To allow us to edit the theme, we utilised a php development program called PHP Storm to allow us to make changes to 
wordpress theme files using the wordpress syntax. This then connected up to our github repository where we stored and shared 
the theme files amoung the group so that anyone could make changes to our custom theme. We continuously made changes to parts 
of our starter theme to further improve the sites' usability and asthetic appeal.

Due to being limited with visualising the changes made in our custom theme, every time an update was pushed to the main branch in 
the github repository, the same ode was copied over to the wordpress theme editor where the corresponding files were updated with identical
code to allow us to visualise any and all changes we had made. To improve on this, there are some paid alternatives that involve webhook plugins
being installed in wordpress and linking with a github repository to listen and retrieve any updates that were to happen in github, as we were unable to 
purchase these webhooks, and could not find any free alternatives, we were very limited to what we were able to do.
