For the website there were a few changes made from the pre-existing theme we decided to use for this project.

These changes include:

The footer and social media link was added as per request of client to promote the social media aspect of this organisation, this will heap entice people to view the Facebook page.

The positioning of the nav bar was changed from the original iteration which improved readability and being aesthetically pleasing, as well as there was a significant change in the background colour to the requested yellow as it will cause the site to ‘pop’ and stand out from the common generic sterilized white aesthetic that's oversaturated in today’s market.

The border around the navigation bar has been added to make each individual drop down menu stand out from one another, this improves the readability of the navigation bar whilst being visually pleasing to the user.
